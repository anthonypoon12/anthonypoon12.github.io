        <p>Hi, my name is Anthony Poon and I am an aspiring software engineer! I am currently a junior
            at Hunter College studying Computer Science and Chinese Flagship,
            and I have two years of experience as a web developer, as well as one internship under my belt!
            Recently, I've started studying data science and machine learning, and I participate in research related to ML at Weill Cornell Research Conor Liston Labs.
            I also really enjoy hackathons, having won the 2022 Stonybrook Hackathon and achieved an award at 2023 HackPrinceton.
            In my freetime, I like to fence, do taekwondo, read webtoons, and watch movies! I also LOVE eating and trying new foods.
        </p>
